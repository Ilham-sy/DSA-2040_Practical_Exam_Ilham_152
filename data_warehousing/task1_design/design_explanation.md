2. Star Schema vs Snowflake Explanation

I chose star schema over snowflake because it provides better query performance through fewer joins, making it ideal for OLAP operations like roll-up and drill-down queries. Star schema also offers simpler maintenance and easier understanding for business users, while the slight data redundancy is acceptable given the performance benefits for analytical queries.
