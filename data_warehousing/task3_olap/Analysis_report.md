The OLAP queries provide valuable multi-dimensional insights into sales performance across regions, time, and product categories.

The roll-up query aggregated total sales by country and quarter, revealing broader sales patterns. For example, the United Kingdom and France showed consistent performance, while Germany had a spike in a specific quarter, possibly due to a marketing campaign or seasonal effect. Such quarterly trends can guide future resource allocation and promotional efforts.

The drill-down query allowed us to focus on a single country (UK) and examine monthly sales fluctuations. This granularity helps identify peak sales months, which may align with holidays or sales events, and supports inventory and staffing decisions.

The slice query filtered results for the Electronics category. Electronics appeared as a significant contributor to overall revenue, justifying strategic focus on marketing, product expansion, or supplier negotiations in this category.

The ability to roll-up, drill-down, and slice data illustrates the strength of a data warehouse in supporting business intelligence tasks. By storing data in a star schema with fact and dimension tables, querying becomes straightforward and efficient.

Since part of the dataset was synthetic, results may not perfectly reflect real-world consumer patterns. However, the methodology remains valid and can be applied directly to real transactional data. The structured approach ensures that decision-makers can access insights tailored to their operational and strategic needs, improving responsiveness and competitiveness.
