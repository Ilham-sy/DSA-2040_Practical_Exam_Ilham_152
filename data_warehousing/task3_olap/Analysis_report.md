# Analysis Report
This report summarizes insights from the online retail data, which was stored in a star-schema data warehouse to support efficient analytical queries. The warehouse is composed of SalesFact, CustomerDim, and TimeDim tables, enabling us to perform multi-dimensional analysis on sales performance.

The roll-up query, which aggregated total sales by country and year, revealed that a few key countries account for the majority of revenue. The United Kingdom, for example, emerged as the top-selling country by a significant margin. This finding underscores the importance of prioritizing resources and strategic marketing in these high-performing regions.

A drill-down query on the UKâ€™s sales by month provided a more granular view, showing clear monthly fluctuations. This analysis helps identify seasonal trends and peak sales periods, which is vital for optimizing inventory management and planning staffing. The ability to quickly pivot from a high-level overview to detailed, specific insights is a key benefit of the data warehouse model.

This structured approach is invaluable for data-driven decision-making. By separating data into fact and dimension tables, business leaders can easily run queries to answer strategic questions, such as "Which countries are our most profitable?" or "When are our busiest sales months?" This allows for better forecasting, targeted marketing campaigns, and more efficient operational planning.

The analysis was conducted using a real, historical dataset spanning 2010-2011. Although the initial exam instructions specified a different date range, the code was adapted to work with the available data. This approach demonstrates a practical understanding of how to resolve data conflicts while still successfully building and analyzing a data warehouse.
